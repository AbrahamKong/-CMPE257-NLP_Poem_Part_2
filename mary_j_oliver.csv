Title,Poem
In Blackwater woods,look the trees are turning their own bodies into pillars of light are giving off the rich fragrance of cinnamon and fulfillment the long tapers of cattails are bursting and floating away over the blue shoulders of the ponds and every pond no matter what its name is is nameless now every year everything have ever learned in my lifetime leads back to this the fires and the black river of loss whose other side is salvation whose meaning none of us will ever know to live in this world you must be able to do three things to love what is mortal to hold it against your bones knowing your own life depends on it and when the time comes to let it go to let it go by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
The Journey,one day you finally knew what you had to do and began though the voices around you kept shouting their bad advice though the whole house began to tremble and you felt the old tug at your ankles mend my life each voice cried but you did not stop you knew what you had to do though the wind pried with its stiff fingers at the very foundations though their melancholy was terrible it was already late enough and wild night and the road full of fallen branches and stones but little by little as you left their voice behind the stars began to burn through the sheets of clouds and there was new voice which you slowly recognized as your own that kept you company as you strode deeper and deeper into the world determined to do the only thing you could do determined to save the only life that you could save by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
Wild geese,you do not have to be good you do not have to walk on your knees for hundred miles through the desert repenting you only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves tell me about despair yours and will tell you mine meanwhile the world goes on meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain are moving across the landscapes over the prairies and the deep trees the mountains and the rivers meanwhile the wild geese high in the clean blue air are heading home again whoever you are no matter how lonely the world offers itself to your imagination calls to you like the wild geese harsh and exciting over and over announcing your place in the family of things by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
Yes! No!,how necessary it is to have opinions think the spotted trout lilies are satisfied standing few inches above the earth think serenity is not something you just find in the world like plum tree holding up its white petals the violets along the river are opening their blue faces like small dark lanterns the green mosses being so many are as good as brawny how important it is to walk along not in haste but slowly looking at everything and calling out yes no the swan for all his pomp his robes of grass and petals wants only to be allowed to live on the nameless pond the catbrier is without fault the water thrushes down among the sloppy rocks are going crazy with happiness imagination is better than sharp instrument to pay attention this is our endless and proper work by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
Happiness,in the afternoon watched the she bear she was looking for the secret bin of sweetness honey that the bees store in the trees’ soft caves black block of gloom she climbed down tree after tree and shuffled on through the woods and then she found it the honey house deep as heartwood and dipped into it among the swarming bees honey and comb she lipped and tongued and scooped out in her black nails until maybe she grew full or sleepy or maybe little drunk and sticky down the rugs of her arms and began to hum and sway saw her let go of the branches saw her lift her honeyed muzzle into the leaves and her thick arms as though she would fly an enormous bee all sweetness and wings down into the meadows the perfections of honeysuckle and roses and clover to float and sleep in the sheer nets swaying from flower to flower day after shining day by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
Next time,next time what do is look at the earth before saying anything stop just before going into house and be an emperor for minute and listen better to the wind or to the air being still when anyone talked to me whether blame or praise or just passing time watch the face how the mouth has to work and see any strain any sign of what lifted the voice and for all know more the earth bracing itself and soaring the air finding every leaf and feather over forest and water and for every person the body glowing inside the clothes like light by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
The summer day,who made the world who made the swan and the black bear who made the grasshopper this grasshopper mean the one who has flung herself out of the grass the one who is eating sugar out of my hand who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face now she snaps her wings open and floats away do not know exactly what prayer is do know how to pay attention how to fall down into the grass how to kneel in the grass how to be idle and blessed how to stroll through the fields which is what have been doing all day tell me what else should have done does not everything die at last and too soon tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
"Where Does the Dance Begin, Where Does It End?",do not call this world adorable or useful that not it it frisky and theater for more than fair winds the eyelash of lightning is neither good nor evil the struck tree burns like pillar of gold but the blue rain sinks straight to the white feet of the trees whose mouths open does not the wind turning in circles invent the dance have not the flowers moved slowly across asia then europe until at last now they shine in your own yard do not call this world an explanation or even an education when the sufi poet whirled was he looking outward to the mountains so solidly there in white capped ring or was he looking to the center of everything the seed the egg the idea that was also there beautiful as thumb curved and touching the finger tenderly little love ring as he whirled oh jug of breath in the garden of dust by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
Breakage,go down to the edge of the sea how everything shines in the morning light the cusp of the whelk the broken cupboard of the clam the opened blue mussels moon snails pale pink and barnacle scarred— and nothing at all whole or shut but tattered split dropped by the gulls onto the gray rocks and all the moisture gone it’s like schoolhouse of little words thousands of words first you figure out what each one means by itself the jingle the periwinkle the scallop full of moonlight then you begin slowly to read the whole story by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
Song for Autumn,don’t you imagine the leaves dream now how comfortable it will be to touch the earth instead of the nothingness of the air and the endless freshets of wind and don’t you think the trees especially those with mossy hollows are beginning to look for the birds that will come—six dozen—to sleep inside their bodies and don’t you hear the goldenrod whispering goodbye the everlasting being crowned with the first tuffets of snow the pond stiffens and the white field over which the fox runs so quickly brings out its long blue shadows the wind wags its many tails and in the evening the piled firewood shifts little longing to be on its way by owner provided at no charge for educational purposes
