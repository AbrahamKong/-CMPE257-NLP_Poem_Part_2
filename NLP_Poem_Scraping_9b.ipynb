She was 83. Bill Reichblum, Oliver’s literary executor, said she died Thursday at her home in Hobe Sound, Florida. The cause of death was lymphoma. “Thank you, Mary Oliver, for giving so many of us words to live by,” Hillary Clinton wrote in a tweet. Ava DuVernay quoted from Oliver’s poem “Praying” and fans online shared their favorite lines. Author of more than 15 poetry and essay collections, Oliver wrote brief, direct pieces that sang of her worship of the outdoors and disdain for greed,  despoilment and other human crimes. One of her favorite adjectives was “perfect,” and rarely did she apply it to people. Her muses were owls and butterflies, frogs and geese, the changes of the seasons, the sun and the stars. “In my outward appearance and life habits I hardly change — there’s never been a day that my friends haven’t been able to say, and at a distance, ‘There’s Oliver, still standing around in the weeds. There she is, still scribbling in her notebook,’” Oliver wrote in “Long Life,” a book of essays published in 2004. “But, at the center: I am shaking; I am flashing like tinsel.” Like her hero Walt Whitman, whom she would call the brother she never had, Oliver didn’t only observe mushrooms growing in a rainstorm or an owl calling from a black branch; she longed to know and become one with what she saw. She might be awed by the singing of goldfinches or, as in the poem “White Flowers,” overcome by a long nap in a field. ___ Never in my life had I felt myself so near that porous line where my own body was done with and the roots and the stems and the flowers began ____ ADVERTISEMENT Her poetry books included “White Pine,” ″West Wind” and the anthology “Devotions,” which came out in 2017. She won the Pulitzer in 1984 for “American Primitive” and the National Book Award in 1992 for “New and Selected Poems.” In 1998, she received the Lannan Literary Award for lifetime achievement. Her fans ranged from fellow poets Stanley Kunitz and Rita Dove to Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush. “Although few poets have fewer human beings in their poems than Mary Oliver, it is ironic that few poets also go so far to help us forward,” Stephen Dobyns wrote of her in The New York Times. Oliver was a native of Maple Heights in suburban Cleveland, and endured what she called a “dysfunctional” family in part by writing poems and building huts of sticks and grass in the nearby woods. Edna St. Vincent Millay was an early influence and, while in high school, Oliver wrote to the late poet’s sister, Norma, asking if she could visit Millay’s house in Austerlitz, New York. Norma Millay agreed and Oliver ended up spending several years there, organizing Edna St. Vincent Millay’s papers. While in Austerlitz, she also met the photographer Molly Malone Cook — “I took one look and fell, hook and tumble,” Oliver later wrote — and the two were partners until Cook’s death, in 2005. Much of Oliver’s work was dedicated to Cook. Oliver studied at Ohio State University and Vassar College, but never graduated and later scorned much of her education as “a pre-established collection of certainties.” She did teach at Case Western University and Bennington College among other schools, although much of her work drew upon her childhood and the landscape around Provincetown. “I am not very hopeful about the Earth remaining as it was when I was a child. It’s already greatly changed. But I think when we lose the connection with the natural world, we tend to forget that we’re animals, that we need the Earth,” Oliver, who rarely spoke to the press, told Maria Shriver during a 2011 interview for Oprah Winfrey’s “O″ magazine. “If I have any lasting worth, it will be because I have tried to make people remember what the Earth is meant to look like.” She wrote often of mortality, but with a spirit of gratitude and completion. In “Circles,” she pronounced herself “content” not to live forever, having been “filled” by what she saw and believed. In “When Death Comes,” she hoped that at the end of life she could look back and see herself as a “bride married to amazement.” ___ When it’s over, I don’t want to wonder if I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don’t want to find myself sighing and frightened, or full of argument. I don’t want to end up having simply visited this world. ___ Entertainment Writer Mark Kennedy contributed to this report.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File) NEW YORK (AP) — With Election Day approaching and the pandemic ongoing, Oprah Winfrey is setting aside her usual book club recommendations and instead citing seven personal favorites, ranging from James Baldwin’s landmark essays in “The Fire Next Time” to Mary Oliver’s poetry collection “Devotions.” Winfrey is calling her choices “The Books That Help Me Through,” works she values for “their ability to comfort, inspire, and enlighten.” “It’s a mix of fiction, poetry, non-fiction and spirituality, books I know and trust and revisit time and again,” she said in a statement Monday. ADVERTISEMENT Her new list, announced in partnership with Apple, includes Eckhart Tolle’s spiritual guide “The Power of Now” and a classic novel she picked in 1996 for her book club, Toni Morrison’s “Song of Solomon.” Winfrey also chose Ta-Nehisi Coates’ prize-winning book on race and police violence, “Between the World and Me”; historian Jon Meacham’s “The Soul of America: The Battle For Our Better Angels”; and an anthology edited by U.S. poet laureate Joy Harjo, “When the Light of the World Was Subdued, Our Songs Came Through: A Norton Anthology of Native Nations Poetry.” Winfrey will “dive deeper into each book” on Instagram, according to Monday’s press announcement, but will not be airing any interviews on Apple TV Plus as she has done with other picks since she signed with Apple in 2019. Winfrey had planned a new choice every two months; her previous selection, Isabel Wilkerson’s “Caste,” was announced in early August. Winfrey spokesperson Chelsea Hettrick said the seven books announced Monday would serve as “a bridge between selections,” and that no firm timeline had been set for future choices. “This year has brought such unprecedented change overall. We will re-evaluate in the coming weeks the selection plan and timing for the remainder of 2020,” she said.

Save this story for later. “The utmost of ambition,” Robert Frost once wrote, “is to lodge a few poems where they will be hard to get rid of”: not on university syllabi but in the memory of a generation. Few poets achieved that ambition more evidently, or more obviously, than Mary Oliver, who died, in Florida, on Thursday, at eighty-three. Though she grew up in Ohio and spent her last years in warmer climes, Oliver and her poetry cleaved closely for most of her adult life to Truro and Provincetown, Massachusetts, to the rocks, birds, mollusks, stunning sunrises, roaming mammals, and thin forests of Cape Cod. The readers who cherished Mary Oliver looked to her for advice about how to live, how to take moments not as tokens to be exchanged for later achievement but as and for themselves. Photograph by Angel Valentin / The New York Times That environment gave rise to poem after poem and book after book (nearly thirty, all told) of secular psalms, inquiries into nature, and reasons to go on living. “What is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?” The question—a good one—that finishes off “ The Summer Day ” may stand alongside “ ’Tis better to have loved and lost” in the annals of sententiae, things much of a generation keeps telling itself, in photo captions, signatures, and subject lines, on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, and on paper. (If I could say so without implying any irony, I’d call it a meme.) Other lines and sentences seem almost as inescapable. “You do not have to be good,” begins “ Wild Geese ”; “You only have to let the soft animal of your body / love what it loves.” Elsewhere: “Fill your hands with the mud, like a blessing.” “My work is loving the world.” Oliver offered a seriousness not tied to a religious orthodoxy, a way to find the numinous through poetry and the outdoors, to avoid dwelling on crowds, modernity, the economy, and their loud demands. It was a way to use words, as she put it in “Sleeping in the Forest,” to dive into some of the “small kingdoms breathing / around me.” And yet these friendly profundities, so widely cherished, so truly useful to so many readers, were not her only tone. The same poet advised you more whimsically to “put a / bracelet on your / ankle with a / bell on it and make a / little music for / the earth beneath your foot.” At her best, she treated her forest dwellers and beach creatures less as religious icons than as quiet friends. “ The Sunflowers ,” in the poem of that name, “have wonderful stories / of when they were young— / the important weather, / the wandering crows.” Another famous poem—the titular poem in 2008’s “ The Truro Bear and Other Adventures ,” though first published in 1979, in “ Twelve Moons ”—delights to imagine a solitary bear, “lucky,” “clever,” “learning to stay away / from roads and houses.” Oliver was not primarily known as a lesbian poet, nor as one who had found human love early—found it, moreover, long before contemporary gay liberation, long before it could be publicly consecrated or declared. But she did those things, too. Oliver shared her Provincetown life for decades with the photographer Molly Malone Cook, who informed some poems but became unmistakable, unavoidable, to many of Oliver’s readers only after Cook’s death, in 2005. An exceptional late poem with the elongated title “Coyotes in the Dark, Coyotes Remembered” remembers how Oliver, upon hearing two voices outdoors she thought to be coyotes, felt “thrilled / to be granted this secret, / that the coyotes, walking together / can talk together.” In fact, she heard “two young women, two-legged for sure / and not at all aware of me,” “two maidens of the wilderness,” who found in each other the grace that Oliver’s verse sought outside the human form. The ache is perhaps generational, and ancient: What kind of writer would Oliver have become if she had been able to be one of them? But she did not mope about such things. The readers who cherished Oliver’s many volumes—who made her one of the two or three best-selling poets in the United States, not for one volume but over many years—looked to her for advice about how to live, how to take moments not as tokens to be exchanged for later achievement but as and for themselves. “What I want in my life,” she announced, “is to be willing / to be dazzled,” and Oliver’s fans could be dazzled along with her. Oliver’s late work can sound like part of a liturgy: “Have I experienced happiness with sufficient gratitude? / Have I endured loneliness with grace?” Such poems turned up in actual liturgies, read from actual pulpits, often: more than one writer has dubbed her “the unofficial poet laureate” of the Unitarian Universalist denomination. The earlier books bring her closer to older poets, in a line of epiphanic nature poetry that has long preferred animals, any animals, and flowers, any flowers, to Homo sapiens . Sometimes she sounds like the early Theodore Roethke; at other times, like D. H. Lawrence, or like her Provincetown neighbor Stanley Kunitz, to whom she devoted a poem with his name in the title: “I used to imagine him / coming from the house, like Merlin,” it opens. For her career shape, and her reception, a better model might be Edna St. Vincent Millay. The teen-aged Oliver showed up one day at the Millay estate, in upstate New York, agreed to work on the papers with Millay’s sister, and ended up living there for “six or seven years.” As with Millay, the fact of her popularity may have discouraged critical interest; as with Millay, her gender, and the gender of her biggest fans, has shaped her reception in some fairly obvious ways. But (as with much of Millay) there is another sense in which the poems just do not need critics: they try very hard to attain the directness of sunlight, the refreshing qualities of spring water and fresh bread, to be good for you without needing you to seed them, peel them, dice them, or process them further first. Not all the readers of poetry in America found ourselves in Oliver’s large audience. But those of us halfway in or wholly outside it, if we are serious about the powers our art form can hold, ought to acknowledge what that audience sought. Oliver’s decades of litanies and rediscoveries provided so many readers with what Kenneth Burke called “equipment for living,” tools to fight gloom, to open the front door, to lead wilder or more precious lives. They also provided advice against selfishness, against self-centeredness, against the idea that experience or authority or cleverness could make you a better person than the rest, or give you the answers that everybody needs. Those answers—and Oliver was usually sure they existed—might be found in owls at dusk, in beach roses, in brief words with one favorite person, in tides on the sand, in the tracks of bears, in the contemplation of wild geese. No wonder so many readers lined up, for book after book, to hear what she wanted to say. Stephanie Burt , a professor of English at Harvard, has written several books of literary criticism and poetry, including “ After Callimachus ,” with Mark Payne.

Save this story for later. With her sensitive, astute compositions about interior revelations, Mary Oliver made herself one of the most beloved poets of her generation. Photograph by Mariana Cook Mary Oliver was a poet who had Greatest Hits. She knew this. It amused her, more than anything—that a sonneteer who wrote mostly about the natural world could have a back catalogue that the public thought about at all, let alone printed out and hung over their desks, or clamored for at readings, or quoted at length on social media. In a 2001 talk to the Lannan Foundation, she introduced “Wild Geese”—which, with “The Summer Day,” is her poetic equivalent of an arena-rock ballad—with a sheepish acknowledgement of its popularity. “George Eliot and her husband, George Lewes, used to refer to some of the material goods that they had by the names of books,” she said. “They would take out their new set of dishes and say, These are the ‘Silas Marner’ dishes, or the ‘Mill on the Floss’ curtains. And we have at least a few cups and saucers that are the ‘Wild Geese’ cups and saucers in our household.” Oliver died on Thursday, at the age of eighty-three, at her home, in Hobe Sound, Florida. But she spent most of her life near a far rockier beach, in the town of Provincetown, Massachusetts, where she lived, on and off, for more than forty years, with her long-term partner, the photographer Molly Malone Cook, who died in 2005. Oliver lived a profoundly simple life: she went on long walks through the woods and along the shoreline nearly every day, foraging for both greens and poetic material. She kept her eyes peeled, always, for animals, which she thought about with great intensity and intimacy, and which often appear in her work not so much as separate species but as kindred spirits. In her poem “August,” Oliver wrote about joy from the perspective of a gregarious bear: “In the dark / creeks that run by there is / this thick paw of my life darting among / the black bells, the leaves; there is / this happy tongue.” In 2013, she published “Dog Songs,” a book of poems and short prose pieces about the passionate attachments between humans and canines. She wrote verse after verse about a little rescue mutt named Percy, about how he gazed up at her “as though I were just as wonderful / as the perfect moon.” With her consistent, shimmering reverence for flora and fauna, Oliver made herself one of the most beloved poets of her generation. She worked in the Romantic tradition of Wordsworth or Keats, but she also infused a distinctly American loneliness into her words—the solitary reflections of Thoreau gazing over a lake, or of Whitman peering from the Brooklyn Ferry at the shuffling tides below his feet. Hers were not poems about isolation, though, but about pushing beyond your own sense of emotional quarantine, even when you feel fear. Everywhere you look, in Oliver’s verse, you find threads of connectivity. In “The Fish,” in which she reflects on eating the first fish she ever caught, perhaps when she was a child growing up in Maple Heights, Ohio, she writes, “I am the fish, the fish / glitters in me; we are / risen, tangled together, certain to fall / back to the sea.” The affinity she felt for the animal kingdom was something more than a banal idea of  “oneness”; it was about the mutual acknowledgement of pain. Whatever the fish felt at his moment of death, Oliver assumed, she, too, would feel. And together they would both become part of the infinite churn. Oliver rarely discussed it, but she escaped a dark childhood. She told Maria Shriver , who interviewed her for a special poetry issue of Oprah magazine, in 2011, that she was sexually abused as a child. “I was very little,” she said. “But I had recurring nightmares; there’s damage.” We are just now starting to have broader cultural conversations about women’s trauma, about how so many women move through the world with heavy burdens. But for more than five decades Oliver gave voice to the process of confronting one’s dark places, of peering underneath toadstools and into stagnant ponds. And, when she looked there, she found forgiveness. She found grace. She found that she was allowed to love the world. When she writes, in her poem “When Death Comes,” “I want to say all my life / I was a bride married to amazement,” she tells us that wonder has to be earned. Marriages are hard work; they take nurturing and constant vigilance. By comparing herself to a bride, she yoked herself to being amazed; she gave herself the lifelong assignment, however difficult, of looking up. When Oliver died, the first thing that I felt, after sadness, was a kind of roiling anger at her critics, who dogged her throughout her lifetime. To her credit, Oliver did not seem much to mind. She rarely gave interviews, and they were invariably gracious and urbane and free of bitterness. As one of her former students wrote on Twitter, “she didn’t even like the phone or attention.” But the critics were there, calling her poetry simplistic, her verse plain. In the Times, in 2011, David Orr wrote, of her work, “one can only say that no animals appear to have been harmed in the making of it”; he added, referring to Oprah ’s poetry issue, which prominently featured Oliver, if poetry “worked as self-help, you’d see more poets driving BMWs.” Despite her numerous accolades—the National Book Award, in 1992; the Pulitzer, in 1984—the Times did not publish a full review of any Oliver book during her lifetime. As Ruth Franklin wrote in a New Yorker profile in 2017 , on the occasion of the release of her anthology “ Devotions ,” Oliver wrote fundamentally accessible poems, “blank verse in a conversational style, with no typographical gimmicks.” She told NPR , in 2012, that poetry “mustn’t be fancy. I have the feeling that a lot of poets writing now, they sort of tap dance through it. I always feel that whatever isn’t necessary should not be in the poem.” Since Oliver died, I’ve seen an outpouring of messages from readers saying that they didn’t know how to love, or even like poetry, until they found her work. It was this accessibility, in the end, that made some critics bristle: they lambasted her—or, worse, ignored her—for being readable and having a throng of fervent (and mostly female) fans, several of whom started devotional blogs, such as “ A Year’s Risings with Mary Oliver ,” dedicated to reading her work as a daily, mindful practice. Oliver’s critics sneered, perhaps with a subconscious (or even purposeful) misogyny, at work that deals primarily with interior revelations and small, daily concerns and observances, like the sound of a lover whistling in another room, or the way kissing feels—“I know someone who kisses the way / a flower opens, but more rapidly.” They also made a category error: formally,  Oliver’s sensitive, astute compositions have nothing in common with the kinds of bland “inspirational” poems that get stitched onto throw pillows or peddled as self-help. As my colleague Katy Waldman aptly put it, as we discussed our shared love of Oliver’s poetry earlier this week, “What happened with Oliver is that the market wanted lesser versions of her, and then snobs got confused.” Of course, Oliver had no control over either her rapturous reception or her critical erasure. She did, however, want her poems to find readers. She told the radio host Krista Tippett that poetry “wishes for a community. It’s a community ritual, certainly.” And her work is so often invoked at communal gatherings—funerals, graduations—that her best lines, such as “Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?,” from “The Summer Day,” have begun to sound like common prayer. But, as with all great poetry, there is pleasure in reading Oliver on one’s own. Her work rewards close, repeated readings, on a snowy day or after a long hike. I keep returning to her 2003 poem “Breakage,” in which her account of a morning walk by the sea becomes a metaphor for the work and pleasure of reading itself: It’s like a schoolhouse of little words, thousands of words. First you figure out what each one means by itself, the jingle, the periwinkle, the scallop full of moonlight. Then you begin, slowly, to read the whole story.

Save this story for later. The widely cherished American poet Mary Oliver died on Thursday, at the age of eighty-three. The poems she published in The New Yorker exemplify the themes and modes for which her work is best known, often addressing the awe of the natural world with studious lucidity, seeking—and finding—the sacred in communion with the commonplace. Whatever Mary Oliver set her attention to became alive, because it became a part of her life, which was a part of all life. Photograph by Molly Malone Cook Oliver’s earliest contributions to the magazine, “ Mushrooms ” and “ First Snow ”—both of which appear in her Pulitzer Prize-winning collection, “ American Primitive ”—infuse vital imagery with the imminent, and immanent, promise of oblivion. The fungi of the former are memento mori, “red and yellow skulls,” “shark-white death angels”: “to eat / is to stagger down,” to live also to die, as the mushrooms—“when they are done being perfect”—“slide back under the shining / fields of rain.” In the latter, snow’s “white / rhetoric,” “calling us back to why, how, / whence such beauty and what the meaning,” is a vibrant force, “an energy it seemed / would never ebb, never settle,” after whose end the “silence / is immense.” The titular predator of “ White Owl Flies Into and Out Of the Field ,” from 1989, might be a metaphor for Oliver’s own poetry—“beautiful / and accurate”—inspiring speculation that “maybe death / isn’t darkness, after all, / but so much light / wrapping itself around us.” The poet’s deep identification with her subjects—even, and perhaps especially, those not human—provides a path to transcendence, however temporary: “I have almost vanished / into the body of the dolphin,” she writes in “ One Hundred White-Sided Dolphins On a Summer Day ,” “into the moon-eye of God, / into the white fan that lies at the bottom of the sea / with everything / that ever was, or ever will be.” Although “an ecstatic poet,” as Ruth Franklin writes , in her 2017 review of Oliver’s “ Devotions ,” “the question that seems to drive just about all Oliver’s work” is one of practical philosophy: “How are we to live?” For moral instruction, too, Oliver turns to nature, as in “ Crows ,” from 2000. “They don’t envy anyone or anything—,” Oliver observes; “Why should they? / The wind is their friend, the least tree is home. / Nor is melody, they have discovered, necessary.” The birds, “as cheerful as saints, or thieves of the small job / who have been, one more night, successful,” lead the speaker to self-reflection: “Should I have led a more simple life? / Have my ambitions been worthy? / Has the wind, for years, been talking to me as well?” And, although, as Franklin points out, “she offers her readers a spiritual release,” Oliver resists easy answers, preferring to inhabit a space of ambivalence, unknowing. “After all / what is Nature, it isn’t / kindness, it isn’t unkindness,” she muses in “ Early Snow ,” from 2001—and, in 2004’s “ Daisies ”: It is possible, I suppose, that sometime we will learn everything there is to learn: what the world is, for example, and what it means. “What do I know,” Oliver asks (without a question mark), “But this: it is heaven itself to take what is given, / to see what is plain.” What is plain to the poet may not be to others, but no matter: “ Some things, say the wise ones who know everything, / are not living. I say, / You live your life your way and leave me alone.”  Whatever Oliver sets her attention to becomes alive, because it becomes a part of her life, which is a part of all life. “Attention is the beginning of devotion,” Franklin quotes, and Oliver’s model for devotion is elemental: “But water is a question, so many living things in it, / but what is it itself, living or not? Oh, gleaming // generosity, how can they write you out?” Generosity, here, is essential to life—and what is attention if not a form of giving? Oliver’s final poem to run in The New Yorker —the only one to take place entirely indoors—is titled “ Oxygen .” “Everything needs it: bone, muscles, and even, / while it calls the earth its home, the soul,” that poem begins, and ends: And what does this have to do with love, except everything? Now the fire rises and offers a dozen, singing, deep-red roses of flame. Then it settles to quietude, or maybe gratitude, as it feeds as we all do, as we must, upon the invisible gift:\n",

“Why should they?/ The wind is their friend, the least tree is home./ Nor is melody, they have discovered, necessary.” The birds, “as cheerful as saints, or thieves of the small job / who have been, one more night, successful,” lead the speaker to self-reflection: “Should I have led a more simple life?/ Have my ambitions been worthy?/ Has the wind, for years, been talking to me as well?” And, although, as Franklin points out, “she offers her readers a spiritual release,” Oliver resists easy answers, preferring to inhabit a space of ambivalence, unknowing.“After all / what is Nature, it isn’t / kindness, it isn’t unkindness,” she muses in “ Early Snow ,” from 2001—and, in 2004’s “ Daisies ”: It is possible, I suppose, that sometime we will learn everything there is to learn: what the world is, for example, and what it means.“What do I know,” Oliver asks (without a question mark), “But this: it is heaven itself to take what is given, / to see what is plain.” What is plain to the poet may not be to others, but no matter: “ Some things, say the wise ones who know everything, / are not living.I say, / You live your life your way and leave me alone.”  Whatever Oliver sets her attention to becomes alive, because it becomes a part of her life, which is a part of all life.“Attention is the beginning of devotion,” Franklin quotes, and Oliver’s model for devotion is elemental: “But water is a question, so many living things in it, / but what is it itself, living or not?Oh, gleaming // generosity, how can they write you out?” Generosity, here, is essential to life—and what is attention if not a form of giving?Oliver’s final poem to run in The New Yorker —the only one to take place entirely indoors—is titled “ Oxygen .” “Everything needs it: bone, muscles, and even, / while it calls the earth its home, the soul,” that poem begins, and ends: And what does this have to do with love, except everything?Now the fire rises and offers a dozen, singing, deep-red roses of flame.Then it settles to quietude, or maybe gratitude, as it feeds as we all do, as we must, upon the invisible gift:our purest, sweet necessity: the air.More: Poetry Mary Oliver Books Books & Fiction Get book recommendations, fiction, poetry, and dispatches from the world of literature in your in-box.Sign up for the Books & Fiction newsletter.E-mail address Sign up By signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement .Read More Page-Turner Mary Oliver Helped Us Stay Amazed With her sensitive, astute compositions about interior revelations and small, daily concerns, Oliver made herself one of the most beloved poets of her generation.By Rachel Syme Postscript Mary Oliver’s Deep, Direct Love for the World Oliver offered a seriousness not tied to a religious orthodoxy, a way to find the numinous through poetry and the outdoors, to avoid dwelling on crowds, modernity, the economy, and their loud demands.By Stephanie Burt Video For the Love of Bread Bread enthusiasts discuss baking techniques and the ways that low-carb diets have villainized the starchy staple.Sections News Books & Culture Fiction & Poetry Humor & Cartoons Magazine Crossword Video Podcasts Archive Goings On More Customer Care Shop The New Yorker Buy Covers and Cartoons Condé Nast Store Digital Access Newsletters Jigsaw Puzzle RSS Site Map About Careers Contact F.A.Q.Media Kit Press Accessibility Help Condé Nast Spotlight © 2022 Condé Nast.All rights reserved.Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our  User Agreement and Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement and Your California Privacy Rights.The New Yorker may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.Ad Choices Do Not Sell My Personal Info\n"

“Why should they?/ The wind is their friend, the least tree is home./ Nor is melody, they have discovered, necessary.” The birds, “as cheerful as saints, or thieves of the small job / who have been, one more night, successful,” lead the speaker to self-reflection: “Should I have led a more simple life?/ Have my ambitions been worthy?/ Has the wind, for years, been talking to me as well?” And, although, as Franklin points out, “she offers her readers a spiritual release,” Oliver resists easy answers, preferring to inhabit a space of ambivalence, unknowing.“After all / what is Nature, it isn’t / kindness, it isn’t unkindness,” she muses in “ Early Snow ,” from 2001—and, in 2004’s “ Daisies ”: It is possible, I suppose, that sometime we will learn everything there is to learn: what the world is, for example, and what it means.“What do I know,” Oliver asks (without a question mark), “But this: it is heaven itself to take what is given, / to see what is plain.” What is plain to the poet may not be to others, but no matter: “ Some things, say the wise ones who know everything, / are not living.I say, / You live your life your way and leave me alone.”  Whatever Oliver sets her attention to becomes alive, because it becomes a part of her life, which is a part of all life.“Attention is the beginning of devotion,” Franklin quotes, and Oliver’s model for devotion is elemental: “But water is a question, so many living things in it, / but what is it itself, living or not?Oh, gleaming // generosity, how can they write you out?” Generosity, here, is essential to life—and what is attention if not a form of giving?Oliver’s final poem to run in The New Yorker —the only one to take place entirely indoors—is titled “ Oxygen .” “Everything needs it: bone, muscles, and even, / while it calls the earth its home, the soul,” that poem begins, and ends: And what does this have to do with love, except everything?Now the fire rises and offers a dozen, singing, deep-red roses of flame.Then it settles to quietude, or maybe gratitude, as it feeds as we all do, as we must, upon the invisible gift:our purest, sweet necessity: the air.More: Poetry Mary Oliver Books Books & Fiction Get book recommendations, fiction, poetry, and dispatches from the world of literature i\n"
